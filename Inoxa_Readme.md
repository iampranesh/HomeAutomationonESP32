Hardware-Based Solutions for Improving Home
 Energy Efficiency
 Challenge Statement:
Modern homes consume significant amounts of energy, with inefficiencies arising
 from outdated appliances, poor insulation, and lack of monitoring systems.
 These inefficiencies contribute to high utility
 costs and increased carbon footprints. 
A practical hardware-based solution is essential to 
optimize energy consumption, minimize waste, and 
encourage sustainable living.

     Develop a Device Name Inoxa Smart Energy Management System (SEMS) that
 integrates IoT-enabled sensors, actuators, and a central control hub. This system will
 monitor energy usage in real time, automate energy-saving actions, and provide
 homeowners with actionable insights to reduce consumption

Sensors We Used on Inoxa
***ACS712 Current  
    HT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
     PIR Motion Sensor
     IR Sensor 
     Water Flow Sensor 
     AC and DC Current Sensor
